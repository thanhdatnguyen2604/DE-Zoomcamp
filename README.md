# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Practice

This repository contains my practice code for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp course by DataTalks.Club, completed in January 2025.

## Overview

This repository includes hands-on practice with:

- Docker and PostgreSQL for data storage
- Terraform for infrastructure as code with GCP
- Python data processing
- Basic ETL pipeline implementation

## Repository Structure
